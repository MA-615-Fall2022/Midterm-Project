# Midterm-Project
This is a midterm project where we extract information from the original strawberry dataset. 
Then we seperate the original dataset into several ones for comparison.
We will be able to compare Organic and Non-Organic strawberries and how chemicals will affect the total number of Sales.
Enjoy
